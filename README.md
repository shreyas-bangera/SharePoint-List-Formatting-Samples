# SharePoint Lis Formatting
You can use column formatting to customize how fields in SharePoint lists and libraries are displayed. To do this, you construct a JSON object that describes the elements that are displayed when a field is included in a list view, and the styles to be applied to those elements. The column formatting does not change the data in the list item or file; it only changes how itâ€™s displayed to users who browse the list. Anyone who can create and manage views in a list can use column formatting to configure how view fields are displayed.
